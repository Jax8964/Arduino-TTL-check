# Arduino-TTL-check

This repository is created in the spring of  2017  for a TTL type checking program written in Arduino.

Creators: Jax Sun, Steve Wang

The TTL check Arduino files are able to use an Arduino board to identify the inner structure of the TTL chip if the chip is correctly connected to the Arduino board.
